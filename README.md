# Welcome to Digyttplace!
This is a personal project that I am running, forked off of an original project from https://github.com/rbxb/place.

# The up-to-date version is up and available at https://place.drapadon.us, and is updated regularly. This version is no longer being updated.

running:

git clone https://www.github.com/digytt/place-old.git

go build cmd/place/place.go

./place -root web/root -port :8080

Additionally, you can spercify -width and -height for the canvas, -wl to enable a whitelist, -count to enable an active users limit, and -load to load an existing PNG for the canvas.

Have fun!
